# FileStore_CloudWiry_Hackathon_2022
For this hackathon, I created a Blob server that receives and stores files directly on the server using FastAPI and MongoDB. You may upload, delete, rename, and distribute files using this API. I've also created a React app that connects to the API and allows you to conduct these functions on the web.

Backend FastAPI is deployed on Heroku:

Frontend React site is deployed on Netlify:

**IMPLEMENTATION:**

_**CheckPoint A: User authentication and session management**_
