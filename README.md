# FileStore_CloudWiry_Hackathon_2022
For this hackathon, I created a Blob server that receives and stores files directly on the server using FastAPI. You may also delete, rename, distribute, and upload files. I've also created a React app that connects to the API and allows you to conduct these functions on the web.
